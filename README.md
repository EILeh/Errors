Errors

Program asks the user to give a word to be guessed. Program "cleans" the
screen by printing empty lines that the word won't show. Program checks after
every guessed letter if the user has already guessed the word and prints the
gamestatus from the information gotten. It also counts the amount of times
user has guessed and if user uses all the guesses, game ends by printing
"Guesses expired!".
